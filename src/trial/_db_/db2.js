The film stars Ryan Reynolds, Mélanie Laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Adria Arjona, Corey Hawkins, Ben Hardy and Dave Franco. Bay produced the film with his longtime business partner Ian Bryce and Skydance's David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Don Granger. It follows a group of people that fake their deaths and decide to form a vigilante team in order to stage a coup d'état against a ruthless dictator.
           6 Underground premiered at The Shed in New York City on December 10, 2019, and was released by Netflix on December 13, 2019. With a budget of $150 million, the film is one of the most expensive Netflix originals ever made. It received generally polarizing reviews, with praise for Reynolds's performance and action sequences, but criticism for its direction and length. Netflix announced plans for a sequel, though due to the film's mixed reviews and the studio's disappointment in the film's lack of creativity, the sequel was officially cancelled.`,

           Originally set for theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Amazon due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and digitally released on July 2, 2021 via Prime Video. However, in China the film kept its theatrical release. It premiered in Chinese theatres on September 3, making $8.1 million its opening weekend. With a budget of $200 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made. The Tomorrow War received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the concept, action sequences, and performances, but criticism aimed towards its derivative execution. A sequel is in development.
